# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress.
The goal of this project is to:
* discover which variables predict the MPG for vehicle prototypes;
* collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of suspension coils from the manufacturing lots;
* determine if manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population;
* design a study to compare the vehicle performance of MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
## Results
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


 ### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coil
 
 * The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

### T-Tests on Suspension Coil
